          <p>
        Welcome to <strong><a href="https://diucoverpage.com">DIU Cover Page (diucoverpage.com)</a></strong>, a student‑built academic cover page generator for learners of Daffodil International University (DIU). Your privacy and the security of your data are important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information, our approach to data protection, and how advertising is served on this site.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Purpose of the Site</h2>
          <p>
        This website is intended solely to help DIU students create academic cover pages for assignments, lab reports, and other submissions. It is operated by an individual owner and is not part of, sponsored by, or affiliated with any commercial organization.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
          <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No personal data collection:</strong>
          <a href="https://diucoverpage.com">DIU Cover Page</a> does <u>not</u> intentionally collect, store, or process personal data. The information you enter into forms is used only to generate your cover page and is not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third party.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Academic use only:</strong>
          All information you provide is used solely for creating academic cover pages and remains within your browser. We do not require registration, login, or any form of personal identification.
        </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
          <ul>
        <li>
          Because we do not collect or store user data on our servers, the risk of a data breach or unauthorized access from our side is minimized.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover page generation is performed locally in your browser. We do not transmit your input data to any backend system.
